        <h1>Welcome to find-a-caddie!</h1>
        <p>Have you ever been playing a round of golf and misread a putt? Misjudged the wind direction? Accidentally hit your 9 iron instead of a 6 iron? Or even worse, hit a hole-in-one with no one around to celebrate with you or even believe the story you tell about it after?  Golf enthusiasts often struggle to find reliable and skilled caddies for their golf rounds. They spend hours researching and contacting various golf courses, hoping to find a caddie available at their preferred time and location. Conversely, aspiring caddies face challenges in connecting with golf players who require their services. This disconnect between players and caddies leads to frustration and inefficiency in organizing a smooth golfing experience.
